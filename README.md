# How to Start Hydra

Hydra is an open-source Python framework that handles the configuration part of your project through config files and the command line.

Until now, this is the best way of configuration handling I found. However, the documentation of this framework seems a little complicated. So I decided to create this repository to explain it in a simple way, just to give you a push to start using this great tool :)
